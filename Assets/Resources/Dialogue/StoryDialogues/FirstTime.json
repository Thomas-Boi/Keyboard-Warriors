		},

			"speech": "Not just any big tech companies, the top 3 at least. Google, Amazon, Facebook,... I want to be where the smartest programmers are."
		},

			"speaker": "Laura",
			"speech": "Well, it wouldn't matter what our plans are if we don't pass this course. I think the work we have to do will be harder than anything we ever faced."
		},
		{
			"speaker": "Robert",
			"speech": "Laura is right. We have to work together to finish this program. The workload is too big for any of us to handle alone."

			"speaker": "Robert",
			"speech": "Laura, can you start setting group studies sessions? Just let us know the schedule when you have it."
		},
