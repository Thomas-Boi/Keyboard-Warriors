## Keyboard Warriors

**Description**
"Keyboard Warriors" is a turn-based RPG where you help a study group get their BCIT diploma by beating up homework monsters.

**How to Play**
1. In this game, the player controls three BCIT students that will have to handle homework each week. The goal of the game is for these students to graduate and the player has to guide them by helping them defeating enemies in the form of turn-based RPG.

2. There are 5 weeks in the storyline/semester. Each week consists of at least 1 and at most 5 different waves of enemies. Each wave consists of at least 1 and at most 5 enemies. To go to the next wave, the player has to beat all the monsters in the current wave. To go to the next week, the player has to beat all the waves in the current week.

3. In each wave, the player will have control over three characters: Tony, Robert, and Laura. For each character, they can choose and execute one action. This can be a skill, an item, or the retreat action. 

4. The play will be divided in turns. The player’s characters will always go first and each one will get a part of the turn. Once all characters have finished their turn, the enemies will take their turn. This will repeat once the enemies finish their turn.

    * If all the enemies die, a new wave will get started and the player’s characters will go first again.
    * If all the characters die, the player fail that week and will have to complete again from the beginning.

5. On each character’s turn, they can choose and execute one action. This can be a skill, an item, or the retreat action. 
    * A skill is an action that is unique to that character. Skills can be used at any time during a character’s turn but they usually have a cost attached. Skills can be used to deal damages, buff allies.
    * An item is a limited action. If the player runs out of an item, they cannot use that action anymore until they buy more of these items.
    * Retreat is the option to withdraw from the battlefield. This can be done if the player feels that they cannot finish the battle and would need more resources to complete it.

6. Skills can cause stress to the characters. Since doing homework takes a lot of work, this can make the characters stress out. If stress goes to 70 or above, the player will take damage and lose their health at the beginning of their next turn. The closer this gets to 100, the more damage the character takes.

7. All characters and monsters have hit points (HP). If a character’s HP hits 0, they go unconscious. They can be revived through the “Floppy Disk” item or when the player finishes the current week. If a monster’s HP hits 0, they will permanently die and remove from the scene.

8. If a character dies and the week finishes, they will not gain any exp from that week.
Whenever the player finishes a wave, they will gain EXP and money that they can use in the item shop. The player has full control on which item they can buy and there is no limit on how many items the players can have.
